# Simple SVN Browser

Simple SVN Browser is a very simple Subversion repository browser implemented
with Python3/GTK3.
It was implemented to have a very basic GUI for browsing repositories from
Linux.
It works by wrapping the `svn` command-line interface.
This made development much faster.
As a side-effect, you'll need to have your Subversion credentials cached for
any repository you browse.
Simple SVN Browser has no mechanism to accept credentials.
